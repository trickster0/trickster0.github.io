After so many days i decided to write my next review! everything is great 10 machines left for finishing the whole lab(including IT,dev,admins). This was a great experience and i learnt a couple of new things! i will write one more review when i finish! it should be in 2-3 days. It took me a while cause i went in a trip for 3 days for a ctf(very hard one with TOO much Social engineering). So after a point machines seemed like a child's play although i had some issues with proxychains, i hope noone will meet them :D Up till now i can say that the hardest machines were freebsd,humble. That is it for me! cya on my next review!! HAVE FUN EVERYONE!
