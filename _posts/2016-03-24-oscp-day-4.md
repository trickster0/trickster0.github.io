This was the worst day in the lab! I probably wasted most of the time of the day in front of my screen. I pwned two machines today. First one was redhat really easy, it took less than 1 hour.The next machine although took the rest of my day... :'( it was horrible and its name is freebsd! Worst machine i have encountered yet! lets hope tomorrow won't be that bad :D That is it everyone have a nice time.
