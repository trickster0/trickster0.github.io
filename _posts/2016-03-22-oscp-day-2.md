Hello everyone! Things are going super great! i managed to pwn 2 boxes! Bob and Oracle. Bob was a very interesting box and i mean it. It taught me windows commands that i never thought i would learn without looking at them :P hahaha the priv escalation aspect was pretty good. Oracle was like umm not saying :P Checking the next box right now, phoenix, let's how things will go ;)
Have fun everyone take care!
