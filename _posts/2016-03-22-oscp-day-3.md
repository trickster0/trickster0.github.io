Everybody, i dont know if it is the practise or something but the lab seems to be getting easier :P I pwned 3 machines today! First was phoenix which had a difficult moment but in general it was super easy! Then i fought with the kraken(yes another mythical creature), that couldnt be any easier. Last machine was mike. Mike was easy too although to actually get the price you needed to complex the things a little bit , but still it was easy too! Let's see what 2morrow has for me ^_^ I know i haven't checked pain,sufferance or humble but the time will come! Have fun Everyone and that is the way it is!
