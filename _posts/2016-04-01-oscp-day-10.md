I haven't been writing for a while about the lab cause i was obsessed with it and kept solving machines or going out.
So i have hacked about 21 machines in total i think included pain and sufferance! I am gonna comment only to those hard ones. Well pain is not a hard one! it is very easy! i think the rumour about it being hard is what makes it hard for people. Actually it was one of the easiest machines i have solved so dont get intimidated! Now about sufferance... sigh...it took me 3 days and someone gave me a hint about the exploit for getting a priv shell. i started great on it got access to all the folders including proof but i had to get the root shell! so i searched for exploits, found the right one but offsec had different plans from me succeeding!That is where i got a hint and managed to get a low priv shell. Then it took me 1 day to finally find how to priv escalation! This machine wasnt easy but not hard either! it takes time though, especially at the part that i got a hint! that is all! tomorrow i am gonna fight with humble and hopefully get root fast :D Have fun everyone!
